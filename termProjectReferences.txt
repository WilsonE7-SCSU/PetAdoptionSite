ChatGPT was used to generate insert statements for sample data in the database.
Sample data and feature code from the pet gallery feature was modified from a project I (Evan Wilson) completed
in CSC235.

Microsoft Copilot was used to build the dynamic pet gallery and its backend route (/api/pets). The prompt was
fine-tuned to use only concepts we learned in class and to match the rest of the project's code.
(The only exception to this is the use of the onReadyStateChange property of the AJAX request, but I used this property
in my CSC235 project, so it is not unfamiliar to me.)
